Create a python code to print a receipt for a retail business. 

The receipt will displayed: 
  name of the store; address; 
  type of transaction: sales, return, or void; 
  itemization of purchased items; 
  detail of the dollar amount paid by customers; and 
  the store return policy.

I started by creating a dictionary that contains the different stores and addresses.
Follow by creating two separate lists, one of products and one for prices.
A variable contains the sale tax to easily access it in case of changes.
